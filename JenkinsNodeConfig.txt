ADD Nodes in Jenkins

Continuous Integration (CI) is the process of automating the build and testing of code every time a team member commits changes to version control. 
Continuous Delivery (CD) is the process to build, test, configure and deploy from a build to a production environment

Pre requistices for agent node.

You will need to install some packages on the agent node, such as Java, as well as any tools that you may require to run your builds 
(Git, Maven, Ant, Gradle, etc.). Iâ€™ll install Java and Git:

Step 1: Install the necessary packages.
  sudo yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk git

Step 2: Create a user on the agent to be used by Jenkins.
  sudo useradd -d /var/lib/jenkins jenkins
  sudo su jenkins
  cd ~
  [jenkins@ansible-remotehost-i ~]$ pwd
  /var/lib/jenkins
  
Step 3: Generate an ssh key.Jenkins will use this key to authenticate with the agent node and log in as the jenkins user.
  ssh-keygen
Step 4: Add the public key to the authorized_keys file of the jenkins user on the agent node.

  sudo cd /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
  cat id_rsa.pub > authorized_keys
  chmod 600 authorized_keys
  
Step 5: Add the agent node via the Jenkins UI.
